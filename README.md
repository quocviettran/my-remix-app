# Demo app!

Main purpose of this project is to make a demo app with remix + vite, and trying out react 19 before its release

## Development

Run the Vite dev server and app:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
